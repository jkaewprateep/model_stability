# model_stability

For study model stability, providing input in the scope of the game environment both similar and different than the training input can provide accurate results that can be trust.

1. We input noises with model prediction performance the same as radio bandwidths, ```temp = tf.random.normal([2], 0.001, 0.5, tf.float32)``` the result can be trusted and accuracy rates are proved by both scoring and game player performance.
2. Input variables we use for AI model ```temp = tf.math.multiply(temp, tf.constant([ coeff_01, coeff_02 ], shape=(2, 1), dtype=tf.float32))``` , the random function is to prove the equation and target possibility.

## Result ##

#### Add noises as random signals and see how much it can perfromace for the same tasks - 100 rounds ####

In short-range performance with different input-to-output contrast different ```distance-velocity``` , that is because the Flappy bird player has sufficient forces and action to create acceleration and drawbacks to keep it moving forward.

#### Add noises as random signals and see how much it can perfromace for the same tasks - 2,500 rounds ####

In short-range performance with different input-to-output contrast different ```distance-velocity``` , we found patterns by visual in graph.

#### Add noises as random signals and see how much it can perfromace for the same tasks - 80 rounds with highest noises ####

The highest noises we can add are not more than 1 / 3 of inputs or the model performance.
